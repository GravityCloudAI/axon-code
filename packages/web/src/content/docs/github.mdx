description: Use axoncode in GitHub issues and pull-requests.
---

axoncode integrates with your GitHub workflow. Mention `/axoncode` or `/oc` in your comment, and axoncode will execute tasks within your GitHub Actions runner.

---

## Features

- **Triage issues**: Ask axoncode to look into an issue and explain it to you.
- **Fix and implement**: Ask axoncode to fix an issue or implement a feature. And it will work in a new branch and submits a PR with all the changes.
- **Secure**: axoncode runs inside your GitHub's runners.

---

## Installation

Run the following command in a project that is in a GitHub repo:

```bash
axoncode github install
```

This will walk you through installing the GitHub app, creating the workflow, and setting up secrets.

---

### Manual Setup

Or you can set it up manually.

1. **Install the GitHub app**

   Head over to [**github.com/apps/axoncode-agent**](https://github.com/apps/axoncode-agent). Make sure it's installed on the target repository.

2. **Add the workflow**

   Add the following workflow file to `.github/workflows/axoncode.yml` in your repo. Make sure to set the appropriate `model` and required API keys in `env`.

   ```yml title=".github/workflows/axoncode.yml" {24,26}
   name: axoncode

   on:
     issue_comment:
       types: [created]

   jobs:
     axoncode:
       if: |
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/oc') ||
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/axoncode')
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         id-token: write
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 1

         - name: Run axoncode
           uses: sst/axoncode/github@latest
           env:
             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
           with:
             model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
             # share: true
             # github_token: xxxx
   ```

3. **Store the API keys in secrets**

   In your organization or project **settings**, expand **Secrets and variables** on the left and select **Actions**. And add the required API keys.

---

## Configuration

- `model`: The model to use with axoncode. Takes the format of `provider/model`. This is **required**.
- `share`: Whether to share the axoncode session. Defaults to **true** for public repositories.
- `token`: Optional GitHub access token for performing operations such as creating comments, commiting changes, and opening pull requests. By default, axoncode uses the installation access token from the axoncode GitHub App, so commits, comments, and pull requests appear as coming from the app.

  Alternatively, you can use the GitHub Action runner's [built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token) without installing the axoncode GitHub App. Just make sure to grant the required permissions in your workflow:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
    issues: write
  ```

  You can also use a [personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)(PAT) if preferred.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use axoncode in GitHub.

- **Explain an issue**

  Add this comment in a GitHub issue.

  ```
  /axoncode explain this issue
  ```

  axoncode will read the entire thread, including all comments, and reply with a clear explanation.

- **Fix an issue**

  In a GitHub issue, say:

  ```
  /axoncode fix this
  ```

  And axoncode will create a new branch, implement the changes, and open a PR with the changes.

- **Review PRs and make changes**

  Leave the following comment on a GitHub PR.

  ```
  Delete the attachment from S3 when the note is removed /oc
  ```

  axoncode will implement the requested change and commit it to the same PR.
